Getting Started (Link NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/)

Newman is built on Node.js. To run Newman, make sure you have Node.js installed. Node.js can be downloaded and installed from here on Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX.
Once Node.js is installed, Newman is just a command away.

npm install -g newman
This installs Newman from npm globally on your system allowing you to run it from anywhere.

The easiest way to run Newman is to run it with a collection. You can run any collection file lying on your file-system. Refer to the collection documentation to learn how to use and download collections.
You can also pass a Postman Collection as a URL. Your collection probably uses environment variables. To provide an accompanying set of environment variables, export them from Postman and run them with the -e flag.
